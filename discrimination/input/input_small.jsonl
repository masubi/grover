It reflects growing concerns that China\u2019s state-owned rail company could hurt American manufacturers and make the system vulnerable to cyber espionage.\nDave Smolensky, spokesman for the China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, dismissed the espionage concerns. The company also said the United States should be promoting competition.\nThe company has won four major U.S. rail car contracts. It is pursuing a Metro contract worth more than $1 billion to build up to 800 of the new rail cars.\nThere are no U.S. transit rail car manufacturers. The bidding deadline is May 31.\n", "domain": "theepochtimes.com", "title": "US Senators Threaten Metro Funding Over Chinese Manufacturer", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 29363, "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-senators-threaten-metro-funding-over-chinese-manufacturer_2880764.html", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "train", "random_score": -4.26355665680627}
{"article": "Transparent may have been renewed for a third season on Amazon just last week, but Jeffrey Tambor\u2018s character is already getting the ax. In a musical send-off for its beloved trans character Maura Pfefferman, the show is planning a short episode where fans will bid farewell to Maura and the Pfefferman family by serenading her with a song.\nAlong with news that Transparent will be renewed for a third season in the near future, Amazon announced that it will hold an aftershow in which fans will share memories and songs in honor of the show\u2019s aging lead character Maura Pfefferman.\nTransparent: We Know Goodbye\nFollowing the episode \u201cWe Know Goodbye,\u201d viewers will get to watch fans reminisce about the beloved character, who was introduced in the third season as her father Mort in the show\u2019s first episode. The short episode will culminate with a rendition of \u201cI Won\u2019t Hate You Anymore,\u201d a hit in 1984\u2019s Coming To America. And yes, it was originally the song performed by Eddie Murphy in the Eddie Murphy film that inspired the Transparent song:\nAmazon\u2019s synopsis for the episode read:\nIn what will be the final episode of the show, Maura (Jeffrey Tambor) bids farewell to her family as she fades away into memory. With memories of their first encounter (and their shared encounter with God) the cast and crew create a musical play, complete with tears, solos, duets, a song about Mufasa (aka she has sex with a gorilla), and a comedic karaoke extravaganza.\nFans have shared their favorite moments from Transparent throughout the past two seasons and will now be able to make those memories in person.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Amazon has launched an aftershow, following in the footsteps of Transparent\u2018s much buzzed-about aftershow \u201c20% Somethings.\u201d It\u2019s a neat move for a show that has been so beloved, and for fans that are so attached to the Pfefferman family.\nDana Brunetti, Netflix\u2019s executive producer and the company\u2019s movie division heads, once told the Hollywood Reporter that Netflix now limits the amount of hours Netflix subscribers can watch an entire season of their favorite shows:\nIt used to be that you had to watch the whole season, but now it\u2019s maxed out at a certain time. If you want to watch the whole season of House of Cards in one night, you have to wait at least a week. Now that we\u2019re more selective with what we give out on this balance, people are getting more time with their favorite shows.\nI guess we can thank Netflix for forcing us to wait weeks to binge on all the great TV shows we love. Though I wouldn\u2019t mind picking up a shopping cart for the Netflix app as we wait.\n", "domain": "slashfilm.com", "title": "\u2018Transparent\u2019 to Kill Off Jeffrey Tambor\u2019s Character in Musical Finale", "date": "April 11, 2019", "authors": "Hoai-Tran Bui", "ind30k": 4999, "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/transparent-jeffrey-tambor-dead-finale/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "train"}
{"article": "In December 2018 the issue of why the Canadian government declined to purchase a second interim supply ship \u2013 a sister ship to MV Asterix which is currently at sea supporting Royal Canadian Navy operations \u2013 became a source of debate in the Commons.\nConservative leader Andrew Scheer questioned the Liberal government why it was not moving ahead with having Davie provide the second supply ship, the Obelix, to the navy. Scheer said the navy needed the second ship.\nBut Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Scheer of playing \u201cpetty politics.\u201d\n\u201cThe armed forces did an assessment,\u201d Trudeau explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t need the Obelix and for him to suggest that we should buy it anyway is pure base politics, the worst politics. We make our decisions based on facts. We recognize the quality of work done by Davie shipyard and we do want them to get good jobs but we are not going to make up work for political reasons.\u201d\nIn February, the Conservatives again went after the issue of the second supply ship and questioned whether the assessment referred to by Trudeau even existed.\nThat is a good question.\nWhen asked about the issue the RCN noted in an email Dec. 20, 2018 to Defence Watch that in November 2014, the navy outlined the high level requirements for an interim AOR capability in a document entitled: Interim AOR (iAOR) \u2013 High Level Requirements (HLRs). \u201cThe specific requirement was detailed in terms of the number of sea days per year and a certain set of key capabilities to be provided, the RCN noted in its email. \u201cThis requirement was intended to meet the RCN needs while progress was made on the Joint Support Ship project which will deliver two JSS PROTECTEUR Class ships as directed in the defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged. There has been no change to the RCN requirements.\u201d\nDefence Watch reviewed that 2014 document and it does not discuss a second interim supply ship, let alone rule out the need for a second vessel. It continually refers to the criteria for a single supply ship.\nThere are also a number of other factors to consider here. On May 30 2018, Vice Admiral Darren Hawco testified before the Senate\u2019s National Finance Committee. He stated: \u201cWe never really looked at the need for or validated the need for a second interim AOR.\u201d\nDavie officials argue the Liberal\u2019s own Strong Secure and Engaged defence policy points to the need for that second ship. The policy calls for two supply ships, one on each coast, operating simultaneously. Currently there is only one ship, MV Asterix. The first new Joint Support Ship isn\u2019t expected for another four years.\nDavie also noted that the money for a second ship is available, pointing out that the Department of National Defence lapsed between $2 billion to $3 billion in 2017/2018. The second supply ship is being offered by Davie for $500 million.\nScheer has committed to building a second interim supply ship if his party forms the next government.\nSome further background reading:\nhttps://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/the-case-for-a-second-interim-resupply-ship-new-stats-show-how-foreign-navies-continue-to-refuel-canadian-navy-ships\n(Analysis)\n", "domain": "ottawacitizen.com", "title": "Military assessment ruling out the need for a second interim supply ship doesn\u2019t appear to exist", "date": "April 16, 2019", "authors": "Updated", "ind30k": 23090, "url": "https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/military-assessment-supposedly-ruling-out-a-second-interim-supply-ship-doesnt-appear-to-exist", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "train", "random_score": -3.8636238954221143}
